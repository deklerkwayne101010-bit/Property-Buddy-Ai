// This would be used if running programmatically
// For now, just providing the SQL setup instructions
console.log(`
ðŸ”§ AI Photo Editor Storage Setup

To set up the storage bucket for image uploads:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage in the sidebar
3. Click "New bucket"
4. Set the following:
   - Name: images
   - Public bucket: âœ… Enabled
   - File size limit: 50 MB
   - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif

5. Or run the SQL script in supabase-setup.sql in your SQL Editor

The API route /api/edit has been updated to:
âœ… Upload images to Supabase Storage first
âœ… Get public URLs for the uploaded images
âœ… Send those public URLs to Replicate API
âœ… Handle optional mask uploads as well

This approach is more reliable than base64 encoding and supports larger files.
